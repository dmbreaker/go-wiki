## Install package `golang` ##

The `golang` Debian package may have already made its way into your Ubuntu distribution. Try this:

```
   sudo apt-get install golang
```

## If that didn't work ##

If you have an arm, i386, or amd64, with the Ubuntu Lucid, Maverick,
Natty, Oneiric, or Precise release, you can easily install Go 1 right
now as a package by running:

```
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/go
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install golang-stable
```

(If you don't have `add-apt-repository`, run "`sudo apt-get install python-software-properties`".)

The `golang-stable` package includes everything necessary for developing
with Go. There are also `golang-tip` and `golang-weekly` packages in the
same repository, and these are up-to-date, except `golang-weekly` isn't
really interesting at the moment since golang-stable is more recent.
