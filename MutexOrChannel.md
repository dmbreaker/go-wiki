# Use a sync.Mutex or a channel? #

One of Go's mottos is _"Share memory by communicating, don't communicate by sharing memory."_

That said, Go does provide traditional locking mechanisms in the <a href='http://golang.org/pkg/sync/'>sync package</a>.  Most locking issues can be solved using either channels or traditional locks.

So which should you use?

Use whichever is most expressive and/or most simple.

A common Go newbie mistake is to over-use channels and goroutines just because it's possible, and/or because it's fun. Don't be afraid to use a <a href='http://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Mutex'><code>sync.Mutex</code></a> if that fits your problem best. Go is pragmatic in letting you use the tools that solve your problem best and not forcing you into one style of code.

As a general guide, though:

| **Channel** | **Mutex**|
|:------------|:|
| passing ownership of data,<br />distributing units of work,<br /> communicating async results | caches,<br />state |

If you ever find your sync.Mutex locking rules are getting too complex, ask yourself whether using channel(s) might be simpler.
