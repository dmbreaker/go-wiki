Since the introduction of the `append` built-in, most of the functionality of the `container/vector` package, which was removed in Go 1, can be replicated using `append` and `copy`.

Here are the vector methods and their slice-manipulation analogues:

`AppendVector`
```
a = append(a, b...)
```
`Copy`
```
b = make([]T, len(a))
copy(b, a)
// or
b = append([]T(nil), a...)
```
`Cut`
```
a = append(a[:i], a[j:]...)
```
`Delete`
```
a = append(a[:i], a[i+1:]...)
// or
a = a[:i+copy(a[i:], a[i+1:])]
```
`Delete without preserving order`
```
a[i], a = a[len(a)-1], a[:len(a)-1]
```
**NOTE** If the type of the element is a _pointer_ or a struct with pointer fields, which need to be garbage collected, the above implementations of `Cut` and `Delete` have a potential _memory leak_ problem: some elements with values are still referenced by slice `a` and thus can not be collected. The following code can fix this problem:
> `Cut`
```
copy(a[i:], a[j:])
for k, n := len(a)-j+i, len(a); k < n; k ++ {
    a[k] = nil // or the zero value of T
} // for k
a = a[:len(a)-j+i]
```
> `Delete`
```
copy(a[i:], a[i+1:])
a[len(a)-1] = nil // or the zero value of T
a = a[:len(a)-1]
```
> `Delete without preserving order`
```
a[i], a[len(a)-1], a = a[len(a)-1], nil, a[:len(a)-1]
```

`Expand`
```
a = append(a[:i], append(make([]T, j), a[i:]...)...)
```
`Extend`
```
a = append(a, make([]T, j)...)
```

`Insert`
```
a = append(a[:i], append([]T{x}, a[i:]...)...)
```
**NOTE** The second `append` creates a new slice with its own underlying storage and  copies elements in `a[i:]` to that slice, and these elements are then copied back to slice `a` (by the first `append`). The creation of the new slice (and thus memory garbage) and the second copy can be avoided by using an alternative way:
> `Insert`
```
s = append(s, 0)
copy(s[i+1:], s[i:])
s[i] = x
```

`InsertVector`
```
a = append(a[:i], append(b, a[i:]...)...)
```
`Pop`
```
x, a = a[len(a)-1], a[:len(a)-1]
```
`Push`
```
a = append(a, x)
```

## Additional Tricks ##
### Filtering without allocating ###

This trick uses the fact that a slice shares the same backing array and capacity as the original, so the storage is reused for the filtered slice. Of course, the original contents are modified.

```
b := a[:0]
for _, x := range a {
    if f(x) {
        b = append(b, x)
    }
}
```
